‚ùì Why would you use #Python for a #prototype only to rewrite the whole thing in #Rust for #production?


üëâ Perhaps you only have 100 ms to make a decision and act on it, before the opportunity is gone which may also cause you to lose money. I heard about a company that has a Python-Rust workflow as described and has such constraints.


üëâ Perhaps you are limited by memory in production or have tight Service Level Agreements or other limitations which are somewhat simpler to manage if you have more low level control.


üí° But why not sketch the solution out in a more high-level Rust already or use a better designed language than Python which makes prototyping even easier? 


ü§î How do you make sure to only transfer the important features without the implementation specific details to the final artifact?
