❓ Do you specify system requirements for web applications?


💡 When you require a certain kind of responsiveness of the system it is important to specify under which conditions the system should fulfill these requirements. And frankly, it also helps reduce liabilities in case the customer really wants to shoot himself in the foot especially if you provide any kind of warranty.


👉 Do you think a minimum of 6 logical cores of a 8th generation Intel Core i5 and 16 GB of RAM is a high minimum requirement for a web app?


🧐 The picture shows the Bloomberg User Workstation Requirements as version 8.7. Yes, that is a desktop application that has an easier time to utilize all the cores compared to a web application.
