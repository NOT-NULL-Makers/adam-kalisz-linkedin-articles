üìö What is you approach to logging and log management?


üí° Good logs contain valuable information. They help with debugging applications, service level improvements and are the basis for insights ranging from security investigations to new business opportunities.


‚ùó Logs can be a liability as well. Too much information can be a burden in terms of privacy for your customers but also employees. Detailed logs accessible to users can aid attackers searching for flaws.


üëâ Many small companies don't have a clear concept what to log, how to do it including where to store those logs for how long and how to analyze them.
