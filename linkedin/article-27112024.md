🔔 The last** rague  eetup **of the year 2024. 🎉


👉 The talk by Matheus Albuquerque of Medallia about how they updated dependencies in a 10 year old project and improved the speed while maintaining compatibility was stunning.


👉 After a brief pause for refreshments Jan Kirchner of Apify gave a talk about improving the developer experience using react-query to fetch data to the front end.


🙏 Thanks Filip Mareš and Karel Žoha for organizing and the sponsors for sponsoring. What a year!
