Yesterday was a packed day at Hewlett Packard Enterprise #AI Roadshow with NVIDIA in Prague. It was packed with success stories, how-to's, roadmap presentations and even a bit of philosophy and socioeconomy.


Thank you Tomáš Kubát Patrycja Sokalska-Pomacho Hynek Cihlář Jakub Linhart Michal Ambler Lukáš Kačena Stephan Reimann Tobias Schiffmann Tjerk Houweling Johan Lagrand David Braun Jan Havlicek Petr Škývara Filip Fiala Stanislav Rampas Adam Bíro Tomas Bimka Vladimir Blazek Jan Nosal Milan Hradil Michal Václavík Pavel Strašlipka


I hope we can continue with sharing the successes and also what didn't work as Jan Prochazka suggested so that we solve real use cases where the value added greatly surpasses the costs, time and trouble and grow the “cake” for everybody.
