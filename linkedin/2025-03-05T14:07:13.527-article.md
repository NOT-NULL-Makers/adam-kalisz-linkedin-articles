Last week, on 24th of February, I attended Prague PostgreSQL Meetup this time in #AWS offices in Prague.


After a short introduction by Gülçin Yıldırım Jelínek, Pavlo Golub gave a practical talk about how you can use pg_watch v3 for monitoring and debugging. So if you are on the hunt for slow queries or want to correlate issues with DDL changes have a look. (The slides are now online as well.)


After the break and tasty fluffy sweets from Turkey Belma Canik continued with a presentation about pgvector and AI-powered text search. We learned about all kinds of tricks and tips such as when to use the IVFFlat vs HNSW indexes or what number of vectors to choose.


At the end there was an example of recommendations engine. A funny suggestion for a 40 year old was to buy “Happy Retirement” party plates.
