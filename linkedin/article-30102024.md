📑 I have** thousands of open web browser tabs **most of the time –⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ until I dump all the URLs and web page titles into a text file and start with a clean slate.


❓ Why?


💡 It helps me search and get back to stuff that I have been researching some time ago and jump into the context –⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ the open tabs left and right from that tab.


💡 Also, Firefox suggests tabs that fit a search query more readily than e.g. bookmarks in my experience.


💡 Most of the time I don't have to do anything. I just leave the tabs open and Firefox restores them when I open the browser anew. Once in a few months when I feel I am in a calmer time I just do a dump which I can always easily search for reference.


What is your approach to juggling multiple projects that need some web research with as little overhead as possible?
