ðŸª™ To try something out on the public internet is inexpensive today. For just under 4 â‚¬/month you can have a virtual server including an IPv4 address. That is completely sufficient for a small company's website, some personal project or learning how to use some of the Linux- or BSD-based operating systems offered.


ðŸ‘‰ That's a lot of value. If you don't need it anymore, you can delete everything and just pay a few cents for what you have used. Great for testing and tutorials. 


ðŸ‘‰ Yet even with these possibilities, more and more people seem to either be total experts or have no experience at all. The middle class of skilled advanced users is shrinking in my subjective experience.


What do you think?
