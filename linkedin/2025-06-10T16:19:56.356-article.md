Yesterday my colleague Daniel Skarda and I have managed to speed up the restore from #Proxmox Backup Server to Proxmox Virtual Environment by patching the way the http/2 connection is utilized so much that we can fully saturate a 10 Gbps link now.


ðŸ“ˆ We will be working with our customer on testing these changes on a 100 Gbps connection in near future and hope to polish and submit the changes to upstream eventually.


ðŸ’¡ We used the Hetzner dedicated server offering in Finland. Specifically two AX52 boxes for 59 â‚¬/month with the added 10 Gbps Intel NIC on both ends (6 â‚¬/month a piece). Including the setup fee of 39 â‚¬ this amounts to 2*59 â‚¬ + 2* 39 â‚¬ + 2* 6 â‚¬ =  208 â‚¬ for the first month and 130 â‚¬ for each month after that. That btw. includes 2*20 TB of traffic each month.


ðŸ’ª The Ryzen 7 7700 is an 8 core 16 thread processor with up to 5.3 GHz boost clock speed and 3.8 GHz base clock. This is great for testing how far you can go with single thread performance. A somewhat comparable offering could be the AWS m6g.4xlarge instance that of course does not include storage and traffic would cost $472.32 if you kept it running for 30 full days in Stockholm, Europe. That's every month, not just the first.


We have published the patched library as a binary for now in Proxmox forums. We would be glad if you could give it a go on your testing infrastructure as well.
