📨 What would happen if your entire e-mail communication leaked? What if you couldn't use e-mail for a few days?


👉 E-mail is still one of the most important official communication channels. Yet most of us don't think twice about who takes care of our e-mail services. The most widely used options nowadays are #Microsoft and #Google. 


⁉️ Do you think these companies care if you have access to your e-mail unless you are one of their biggest clients? If you are not 100% sure, do you do e-mail #backups? How do you secure your access to the e-mail be it online or in the backup?


🔥 What about those companies that have an internal e-mail server. You do have good backups and a stand-by server in an alternative geographic location, right? Because how else will you send e-mails in case of a fire, flood, electrical accident, operator mistake? What about all the #security and #privacy aspects?


👉 For European companies, how do you make sure the e-mail is stored in Europe to fulfill regulatory requirements?
