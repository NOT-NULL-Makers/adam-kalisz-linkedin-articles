🔐 IT security in SMBs in a nutshell: Insufficient** segmentation**, insecure** passwords**, bad** backups**.


‼️ According to Akamai, a leading Content Delivery Network,** four out of five breaches **are partially attributed to the use of weak or stolen passwords.


👉 Just start using password managers already. Reduce the number of passwords you have to remember to 1-2 and keep the rest in the password manager where you don't care if they are long and randomly generated because you don't have to remember them. Some password managers will fill them out for you in most places and you can Copy&Paste elsewhere.


👉 Use tokens/ 2 Factor Authentication where needed for additional protection.


👉 Limit the number of tries and alert on suspicious activity where possible. Try to only alert when the danger is real. If does not make sense to desensitize people - we should all be alert when we are under a real attack.


‼️ Limit** reachability and permissions**. The printer on the shop floor does not need to have direct network access to computers in finance. It should only see a print server, some DNS server, perhaps a directory controller and a file server to store scanned documents if it can do that. Perhaps it can communicate with some monitoring server or service to alert on low ink/ toner or other issues but that's really it.


 👉 Segmenting the network and setting up permissions to a reasonable degree decreases the blast radius considerably. It makes life more complicated for attackers and if kept at a reasonable level isn't really all that much work. It can simplify the operations too because smaller network segments tend to be less chatty and people who have no permissions to some important folders of another department can't mess up accidentally.


‼️ Make** backups **and test the ability to** restore **from them.


👉 Don't do backups on media that are likely to be affected by theft, fire, water, electrical problems just like the system you backup. 


👉 You should have some backup or at least last resort backup – disaster recovery procedure instructions and data ideally in a different building.


Really, all of this is not much work. You probably have to do some of it anyway because of some regulation that you don't know about. In the European Union that touches on General Data Protection Regulation #compliance. Also it's the bare minimum you can do against #ransomware attacks.
