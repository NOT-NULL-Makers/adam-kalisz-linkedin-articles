Finally! We have managed to speed up Proxmox Server Solutions restore of backups from the #Proxmox Backup Server considerably.


Daniel Skarda and I have produced a patch for the ðŸ¦€ #Rust utility so that the restore can now saturate a 10 Gbps network. We currently don't have any faster connection to test however you can try yourself just let me know in the comments if you are interested.
