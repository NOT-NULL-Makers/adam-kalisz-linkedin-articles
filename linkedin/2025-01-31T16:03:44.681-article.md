🌍 Most people do not have a good intuition about the speed of light compared to how big a place the Earth is. That's a reason why the biggest computer hosting providers provide their services in multiple places on most continents and provide tools 🛠️ to measure the delay between your location and the data center from the viewpoint of the network.


🌐 This can be less intuitive as we experience submarine cable cuts or have special circumstances e.g. by using a satellite network. 🛰️


💡 Windows, macOS, Linux and various other operating systems have basic tools built in which enable you to do a similar analysis. They are quite handy to diagnose many networking problems of many kinds even at home. They are used from the command line or terminal. The command is called ping.


Used like this:


ping example.com


Instead of example.com you can also type IP addresses but LinkedIn does not like that in posts. On Windows it will ping 4 times by default, on macOS or Linux you have to stop pinging by closing the window or hitting Ctrl + C.


👉 I wrote a small program that takes the regions and for each of them pings the #AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service endpoint. For me the nearest is eu-central-1 which seems to be in Frankfurt, Germany. eu-central-2 in Zurich, Switzerland and eu-west-3 in Paris, France are not far behind.


🧐 You can see a big jump as we cross the Mediterranean Sea to Israel and the Middle East on one side and the Atlantic Ocean to North America on the other. Feel free to try pinging for yourself!
