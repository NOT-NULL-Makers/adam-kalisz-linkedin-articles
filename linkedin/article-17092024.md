** cluster node in an unknown state**.


In #Proxmox if you reorganize cluster storage you can get into a state, where one or more nodes display** state unknown**. This is especially easy if you do stuff on the command line with pvesm, editing the pve files by hand or change the state using native GNU/ Linux commands and for one reason or another don't establish the same state on cluster nodes.


Looking into logs with journalctl the mistake seemed obvious as seen in the screenshot.


The "stuck" case can be resolved rather easily. The mount command lists all the mounts. umount -lf <mount path> forces a lazy unmount, which takes effect immediately and the state unknown status disappears as well.


What are your experiences with using Proxmox in production?
