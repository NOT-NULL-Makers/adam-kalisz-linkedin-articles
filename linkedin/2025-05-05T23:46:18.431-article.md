🐛 Do your admins and developers maintain your business critical systems like this?


😈 The answer is probably YES.


👉 Because it's really hard to create and maintain processes that prevent such slip ups.

👉 Because there seems to be no value in maintenance. It's a cost center and does not show up in growth.

👉 Because most companies also have such holes and they seem to do fine.


There will always be an excuse to not do things properly. That's probably how Riga ended up with a hole like this one just across the street from the Latvian Academy of Sciences not far away from the Museum of the Riga Ghetto and Holocaust in Latvia.


This prolonged negligence or even carelessness will leave any organization in such a disarray and with a culture that real fixes will be a heroic act. And just like with Latvia after the fall of the Soviet Union it might be the case that if the organization survives at all these accumulated mannerisms will poison everyday life even 35 years later.
