If you missed that one hit recently in a Multi-Player or have really stuttery voice calls or video-conferences, bufferbloat might be a big contributor.

You can check some of these manifestations using this online tool: https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat

You can contribute a little to help make this problem go away globally and with a bit of effort can reap the benefits today at home or at work. Please consider donating or organizing other support.
