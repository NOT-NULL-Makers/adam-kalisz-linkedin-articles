ü§î For the last few years I think about the ‚Äúcompete, compare, converge‚Äù development model. This works for pairs or small teams of 3-5 people at most and on tasks that should take about 1 day if you don't include corporate overhead. It is a special kind of hackathon basically.


üëâ Yesterday, V√≠t Kalisz and I did some conversion of 11319 bills in XLS to a new template in XLTM to fit an existing workflow at a car dealer. Yes, this was AI/ LLMs assisted and partly thanks to this were done in a few hours including the conversion itself and finding a conflicting setting in Excel that would cause PDFs to be printed in Letter instead of A4 format.


‚ùì So how does this work?


‚Ä¢ You compete in the beginning when you research the problem and work on a partial solution.

‚Ä¢ You compare where you got on your own and what the open problems are.

‚Ä¢ You pick the more suitable approach and take it over the finish line.


üí° We quickly found out #Babashka with bb-excel nor #Clojure + Docjure (Apache POI) will not get us over the finish line fast enough. The second might have gotten us to a solution eventually but V√≠t already had a solution using #Python + openpyxl. Yes, we could have used libpython-clj bridge from Clojure as well but this was a short enough task that it wouldn't pay off.


Do you have a similar experience?
