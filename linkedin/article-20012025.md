Coding may be dead ☠️ but #software #engineering is not.


💡 Currently, most #AI tools can code relatively simple tasks in mainstream languages but not complex tasks in niche languages. Do you want to try? Ask any of these tools to implement a simple ICMP ping program in Common Lisp and try to run it.


👉 Being a great software engineer always meant to think clearly, have a lot of experience and respect for the problem space and the people involved. You need to #understand what the code should be doing and what it will do in reality. You are #responsible for the code you produced using LLMs or not.


🛠️ Yes, we now have tools to solve some problems well enough that were previously tough to solve. For us to do more we need more #simplicity otherwise we will drown under all the cruft and neglected #maintenance.


📞 For example chat bots. LLMs/ AI can help with those and they can be the most empathetic and helpful #support staff you have encountered. But that takes a lot of #work – now the IT people have to understand what it is like to be helpful, empathetic, how to deescalate and more because how else would you like to know the bot does well in testing?


🔥 The advancements in LLMs have opened new opportunities for #automation but also uncovered many problems in computer #security because a lot more people can now throw a few lines of code together without any clue whether it is malicious or has vulnerabilities.


💪 All this will eventually just mean a lot more work. However the barrier to entry will be different because LLMs will make some things easier and some will stay hard and probably be much larger problems than before.
