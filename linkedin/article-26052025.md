❗Incomplete and out-of-date documentation turns customers and partners away.


👉 Good documentation increases the ability to solve problems on your own, which increases buy-in and trust.


👉 Yes, you can test people's patience and get a small number of fervent followers but will turn off many casual supporters or those that are just tipping their toes away. Great idea if you want to create a secret society, not if you aim for a going concern.


🙏 Proxmox Server Solutions could you please provide up-to-date instructions on how to build your stuff? Especially proxmox-backup-qemu?


🧐 The restore process cannot fully utilize a 10 Gbps connection slowing large restores down. I do have some ideas what to change so I get better performance but I seem to be missing some secret sauce to get a number of dependencies installed. There seems to be a repository missing that is not documented.
