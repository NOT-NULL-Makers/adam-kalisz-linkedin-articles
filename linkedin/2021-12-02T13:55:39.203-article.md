Is it just me, or are you also unable to scroll up or back in history in the message window here on #LinkedIn in #Firefox 78 ESR? There is just no scroll bar for me. I appears, the text is there but just hidden in a lower layer or something. I think it is a #bug and at least to me, it is infuriating.

I am able to select the message history beyond the chat box frame and Copy&Paste it e.g. in a text editor. That is my workaround, to see at least some history.
