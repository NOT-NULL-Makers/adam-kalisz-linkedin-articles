❓ Is it hard to learn computer #programming or as some say coding?


👉 It all comes down to #leverage. With the right #tools it's not that hard to do basic programming. Programming is a complex #skill you can learn and some can master.


❓ So why do so few people actually program?


👉 As with any skill, computer programming requires an #investment. Of time, focus, effort, often equipment and money. It also helps if you can type quickly or know in general how to navigate the concrete computer system.


👉 You can program visually using a prepared environment. Various low-code or #automation platforms, games and specialized systems will allow you to accomplish many things. I would count even complex alarm clock routines among these. Working with date and time reliably and considering things like daylight savings or timezone changes is not a negligible feat.


👉 Or you can go deeper or low-level and setup a programming environment with a programming language. On this level you are more in #control but you need to know a lot more stuff from all kinds of areas. The more control you want the more you need to step up. The more things you need to guarantee the more you have to consider.


🛠️ And there is a lot more context that we in the industry describe as #domain #knowledge. For instance the braking of a modern electric car is a computer routine that needs to manage the electric motor to recuperate as much energy as possible but also needs to apply the brakes at least sometimes to prevent corrosion. And all this needs to happen as quickly as possible. A depressed brake pedal needs to apply maximum braking force but in some circumstances not all wheels should experience the same braking force to prevent skidding all while detecting brake slippage when the brake pads are worn too much. And there is a lot more that I don't know about electric car braking because I have never programmed or generally done anything with EVs besides driving.


🫴 While you can learn a bit of programming in a day and you should try that, most professional software engineers and programmers generally would be careful to say which kind of programming they feel comfortable at and which they would need to explore in more depth before being confident in the results in the specific domain and development efficiency.


🧐 Also that you can program something does not mean you can easily take over code produced by other people or the other way around. Finding issues and their causes – #testing and #debugging is another skill I will write about sometimes else.
