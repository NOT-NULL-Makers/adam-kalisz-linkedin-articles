I am doing a bit of benchmarking of the backup restore from #Proxmox Backup Server to Proxmox Virtual Environment.


I am trying to find the bottleneck that is slowing down the restore between these high-frequency 8 core, 64 GB RAM, 2x 1TB NVMe SSD server with 10 Gbps NIC (Hetzner AX52 + 10 Gbps NIC).


The restore is even slower if you have a number of incremental backups like the 14 in my case. 90% of those images is always new urandom generated data. Before I had more backups, I was seing ~500 MBps restore speed. Currently I am at ~430 MBps.


What are your experiences with Proxmox Backup Server?


Thank you Mathias Rumbold for opening the PBS topic in your post yesterday.
