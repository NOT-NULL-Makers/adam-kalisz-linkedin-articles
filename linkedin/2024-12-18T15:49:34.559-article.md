ðŸ¤” What is the #lighthouse score of your company's #website?


ðŸ‘‰ Yes, static sites have an advantage. However we have a large picture over almost the full screen, which is a performance disadvantage. It's a decision to put the team front and center, because we are the ones converting experience into expertise you can leverage to remove obstacles and improve outcomes for your company.


ðŸ’ª We are not done by far. There are many improvements we can still make e.g. around caching and other headers on the technical side. Also, we will have more pages with details and more on the content side.

Can you post the desktop and mobile score for your company?
