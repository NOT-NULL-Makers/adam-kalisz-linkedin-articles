In 4️⃣1️⃣8️⃣ days the support for Windows 10 will end❗ That is, the current version 22H2 will no longer receive security or other patches after 14th of October 2025. Have you migrated to Windows 11 yet?


Also beware, Windows 11 will require Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 and possibly other hardware capabilities.** evices released before the year  might not be fully supported**. You should check whether you need to upgrade your hardware as well.


The Windows 10 Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) versions will continue to receive updates beyond that date based on their specific lifecycles.
