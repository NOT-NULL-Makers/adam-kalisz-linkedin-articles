Naming and expressing things is hard. We thought about our #logo a long time.


NOT NULL Makers has the exclamation mark and empty set/ slashed zero symbol as a fundament. The bang symbol is often used in programming to express negation ”not“ and empty set often represents ”nothing“ the same as NULL. Forgive some simplification here. Also NOT NULL is a common condition when querying a #SQL database or specifying a constraint on a column.


Finally, NOT NULL Makers denotes that we do more than something without value → we contribute something of value. Yes, it's a little around the corner but frankly most people just take it as a distinctive symbol and abbreviate the company name with NNM or much less frequently !0 and that is fine with us.


And yes, we have an octopus variant of the logo. It's a clever, flexible animal that can adapt to many circumstances. And we think our octopus is cute as a mascot.


What is the story of your company's name and logo? Do you have a mascot?
