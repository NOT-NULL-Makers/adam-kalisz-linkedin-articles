There are special engineering and financial fields where the year aligns months differently. In computer systems, it can be useful to adjust their sorting.


For instance in this example the year would start in November. Therefore, if we want to sort months in a year, January would be the third month, February fourth etc. In #Clojure, we can just write a mapping and a custom comparator. We can use this infrastructure to then use the sorted-map-by function to produce a sorted-map with this custom sorting.


Useful if you want to do some kind of interpolation for instance or just want to print the values in a way your domain expert colleagues understand. Or you just want to sort things once e.g. on data ingestion and rely on that fact.


Where do you use sorted-maps?
