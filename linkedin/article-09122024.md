💡 You can extract the timestamp of a LinkedIn post or comment from its URL with millisecond precision.


👉 While archiving my posts I wanted to do a little statistics and include this metadata for later reference. Ollie Boyd figured out that the timestamp is included in the first 41 bits of the number. He even has a simple online tool doing the conversion.


👉 I have taken a slightly different approach, I just do a bit-shift on the number and I have utilized #Babashka/ #Clojure by Michiel Borkent because that's an environment in which I want to do the rest of my conversion.


❓ Do you have such scripts making your job easier? Have tried scripting things using AI tools?
