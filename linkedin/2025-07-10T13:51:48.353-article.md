Why can't we also collect any receipts by using the bank card?


ðŸ‘‰ This way we could get rid of all the little or large pieces of paper that may be unreadable as early as by the end of the month.


ðŸ“· No scanning or photographing of these sometimes very long pieces of paper. Instead a nice HTML document unbounded by the physical paper formats.


ðŸ“š For those that like paper records there could be an option to export to PDF for printing in a more convenient A4/ Letter format than the narrow but long receipts everybody has to fold carefully and then try to somehow fit onto the scanner or into the cameras frame.


ðŸ‘‰ You could sort and download all the receipts all at once as a batch.


ðŸ“ˆ This could also work for wire and SEPA transfers. You wouldn't need to do the e-mail dance where things may end up in spam and everybody has their own format.


ðŸ‘‰ And if you have solved receipts, this could perhaps solve invoices too. This could greatly reduce the burden when sending by e-mail, avoid a great number of fake invoices, phishing and malware spread.
