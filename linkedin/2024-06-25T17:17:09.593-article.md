Yesterday, I was lucky to attend a PostgreSQL Meetup in Prague again. Gianni Ciolli spoke about the Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA) tool that helps with setting up PostgreSQL clusters using Ansible and other tools in an predictable and quick manner. Good for testing or managing many clusters. Also, Gianni is a really fun guy to listen to!


Tomas Vondra spoke about where performance cliffs come from. He explained that the query planner estimates costs in terms of probable resource usage not necessarily the execution duration. Also, he mentioned that JIT can actually make the execution time worse, because the compilation itself might take a long time. This is currently hard to predict beforehand and therefore might be better to only turn on JIT for queries where it actually helps.


Thank you Kiwi.com for hosting the meetup and Gülçin Yıldırım Jelínek for organizing and letting us taste traditional Turkish pastries with cheese!
