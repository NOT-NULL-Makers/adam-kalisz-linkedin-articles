🤔 #AI 'can already do all of the jobs' says payment processing platform #Klarna's CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski.


⁉️ Yet the company is still advertising jobs online. Does it mean the CEO is acting in bad faith towards those whole already applied without the knowledge of his stance?


👉 Even if Klarna is backfilling some essential roles statements like this sound quite myopic or worse – arrogant to me without diving too deep into the details.


What do you think? Would a statement like this be something you would consider quitting over?
