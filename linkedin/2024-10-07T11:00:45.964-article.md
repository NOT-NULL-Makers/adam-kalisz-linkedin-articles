**lease rid me of this nonsense**.


If you want newer, faster, nicer laptops just go and buy them.** on**'**t make up reasons **or excuses from thin air. Yes, $3,300 is a lot for a laptop but yes, great developers probably make more in one or two weeks.


• But, are you sure you are really** limited on build time**?

• If so,** why not have a build server **that can have much better cooling and higher power budget than a laptop?

• Is there a better technology that does not require builds at all or where the builds are less costly?

• Have you** tried caching results **from previous builds?

• Do you absolutely** need so many builds **that it becomes the limiting factor?


Perhaps there is a better way. But can your engineers find it and explain it in a way that it at least sounds reasonable?

[We recently found that the new 2021 M1 MacBooks cut our Android build times in half. So for a team of 9, $32k of laptops will actually save $100k in productivity over 2022. The break-even point happens at 3 months.TL;DR Engineering hours are much more expensive than laptops!Source: https://x.com/softwarejameson/status/1455971162060697613](./media/build-time-apple-m1.png)
