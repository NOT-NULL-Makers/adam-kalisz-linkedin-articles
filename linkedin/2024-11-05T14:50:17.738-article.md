ü™ô Do you know what the** value **and** cost **of** information **is at your company and how it develops over** time**‚ùì


üí° A great question presented in the lecture from 1982 by then Captain Grace Hopper called "Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People" which you can find on the YouTube channel of National Security Agency.


üëâ The idea of determining what information or data to keep in the most powerful and expensive online part of the system, which to archive and which to delete entirely should be investigated more thoroughly. In Amazon Web Services the costs to keep data online can be as high as 23x if you compare AWS S3 Standard for the first 50 TB vs S3 Glacier Deep Archive.


üëâ Also, if you have good metrics about your data you can use cashes more efficiently or build indexes to speed up your processing.


üëâ Information incurs more than just storage and traffic costs. Somebody has to maintain the systems, do the retrieval from archives, verify backups, pay the electricity and internet connection etc. Also in the case that some information is incorrect or missing your organization might be sued. As Hopper mentioned, the US Privacy Act of 1974 explicitly allows a civil action against an agency in such a case. The General Data Protection Regulation (#GDPR) and other laws have similar and broader effects in the European Union. Hopper also mentions segmentation by confidentiality level, security in general and touches on information and misinformation. Perhaps we should all take a note from that and ask ourselves why more than 40 years later we are still struggling with that.


ü§î Hopper underscores the need to model information flow in the organization and implement systems based on that. Most organizations use approaches that make working with information or data more difficult than it needs to be. She talks about modularization and splitting large systems into smaller, more manageable ones implicitly with a better price to performance ratio and a lower total cost. I think, Hopper would be quite mad about how some real world micro service implementations turned out ‚Äì where the segmentation, modularization and information flow is wrong and therefore the total cost is actually higher than a sane modular yet more monolithic implementation could be.


The lecture is enjoyable and filled with interesting points and life lessons. Comment what you found most interesting after seeing it!
