‚ùì #Clojure for prototype and #Rust for production. 


‚ôªÔ∏è I have touched on the topic of language A for prototype and language B for production a month ago. There it was #Python and #Rust but more or less the same arguments apply, with a few distinctions.


üëâ The #Java Virtual Machine (#JVM) that Clojure runs on is better suited for demanding workloads thanks to its Just In-Time (JIT) compiler, advanced garbage collection engines and the approach to multi-threading than Python.


‚ûñ But the JVM and Clojure are not a glue platform as Python is often viewed. They need a bit more specialized knowledge to a degree that with the previous it just might be the right platform for prototyping and production even under some of the same limits that would prevent the use of Python.


∆õ Clojure is a niche language and it might be a detractor to some. However at the same time it is well designed and can be learned quickly for basic data processing. For high #performance you need specialized knowledge just like in any other language.


ü´¥ What's your take on this?
