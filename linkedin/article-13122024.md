⁉️ Programmers procrastinate in** arguments about pointless details **such as whether you** indent **program text –** code with tabulators or spaces **among other things.


👉 And because the arguments get long they shorten tabulators to tabs.


💡 I don't frankly care, my editor or Integrated Development Environment does it for me automatically well enough that I never bothered to take a look, if it uses tabulators, spaces or a combination thereof and which length of tabulators.


Especially the C, C++ and Python community seem to be in a prolonged war about this.
