🔥 Fire, 🌊 water, ⚡ electricity problems, 🔐 computer viruses, 🥷 theft, ⚔️ war or a plain mistake 🤦‍♂️ all endanger your data. 👉 Do #backups and test the #recovery.


🙏 This is a tough topic, especially if you have lost someone or substantial property due to a disaster. Again and again most people and companies are not fortunate enough to have made even minimal preparations for the case of a disaster.


👉 Recent events such as the Palisades #fire in California or the #ransomware incident at Slovakia's Geodesy, Cartography and Cadastre Office (Land Registry) show that you never know when you would wish for solid backups, disaster recovery preparations, robust safety and security practices and staff training in the event of a crisis.


🫴 If you survive a disaster only to find out your digital life was also almost wiped out it's making recovery all the more difficult. It's likely you will have trouble logging in anywhere without your smartphone, laptop, wallet, government or other IDs. You might end up somewhere where nobody can vouch for you. That means you will have trouble paying for anything as well.


👉 Do stash certified true copies of important documents and a bit of cash with a trusted party that will recognize you without any other identification. Make sure it's far enough to not be hit by the same disaster but be reachable ideally on foot or a short car ride from you.


👉 For important company documents make sure you have copies at a bank and/ or your lawyer that will be accessible in case of an emergency.


👉 Have good backups that you test for recovery regularly and would have access to in case of an emergency. Include an access token of some form with the document stash.


💡 If your home or the company headquarters burns to the ground terrible as it is you shouldn't have to worry about essentials such as proof of identity or ownership, contacts, ability to access important accounts or data or functional payment options too.


👉 Hopefully, you will never require these precautions but should you, you will have much better chances of getting on your feet again somewhat soon.
