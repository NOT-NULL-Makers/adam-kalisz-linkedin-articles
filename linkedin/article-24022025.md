❓ Why #Clojure? Or rather „Why not Clojure?”


👉 Many projects decide to write in #JavaScript, #TypeScript or #Java, C# or some hip language. Those that chose Clojure or think about choosing Clojure know why. But those that are thinking about the more mainstream options should also ask the question „Why not Clojure?”


🧐 Perhaps Clojure would help solve some of their technical challenges from the start. The simple syntax, strong concurrency features, stability, the possibility to use libraries from the Java and JavaScript ecosystem (for ClojureScript) make it a no-brainer for many projects.
