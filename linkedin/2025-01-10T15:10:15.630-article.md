📡 People often #blame the #network for technical problems that have nothing to do with it.


🐌 The application is slow – the network is at fault.


️‍💥 The application does not work – it must be the network again.


😈 We were infected by #ransomware or some other computer virus or the data leaked to the public? If we did everything with pen and paper instead of everything being #connected to the #internet this would never happen.


👉 Sure, the network and related services such as the Domain Name System (#DNS) server or the Network Time Protocol (#NTP) server can be at fault in surprising ways but it's not helpful throwing around assumptions without a good reason such as failed tests of reachability, name resolution, monitoring data, logs, traces etc.


🙏 If you are lost take a deep breath and try to provide a good description of the problem, screenshots and notes about actions and the timing are a good start when you want to ask for help. Being respectful towards the person you are asking is a good start, also leave any blame for later if you absolutely must blame at all. 


💡 Usually honest people know they have messed up and will apologize on their own. You don't have to give them a hard time in addition to what they put themselves through. It's a learning opportunity for everybody.

Forgiving does not mean you have to forget. When somebody messes up too much, due to negligence or is rude about it you can part ways, demand compensation etc.


Did you blame the network at some point? Were you on the receiving end of the blaming? Was it actually something network related?
