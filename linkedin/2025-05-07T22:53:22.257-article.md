‚ÅâÔ∏è Imagine this: Tomorrow, the US Department of Treasury through the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) will mandate that American organizations ensure any projects they control, including Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects, are not used in any way by sanctioned organizations or people associated with them ‚Äì similar to the already existent Specially Designated Nationals list. What would you do if you or your company would be the collateral of these sanctions?


üò± What are your contingencies for a case when you just cannot pull sources/ binaries from the web, be it because of sanctions or simple unavailability of a repository?


ü§î Can you even build your software artifacts in such a situation?


üßê What about deployment?


üí° Here are a few projects you might recognize and the country the supporting organization is registered in.


üëâ Of course you can keep the current sources of everything stored at your company. But can you actually turn these sources into binary artifacts the computer understands without the projects supporting build infrastructure?


‚ÅâÔ∏è Now do you also use proprietary software that needs to be registered using some internet endpoint, generated key or something? Do you think that would work in such a case?
