We did enjoy the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Day in Prague today!


It was an opportunity to meet some friends from the community e.g. David Karban, Ondrej Manasek and Michal K√°rn√≠k.


üí° Among many great conversations and talks I would like to highlight the talk funnily labeled as AIM404 "Deep dive into Amazon Aurora and its innovations" by Elena Yukhymenko, Senior Database Specialist SA at AWS. Besides a lot of technical detail such as performance advancements from tiered caching it showed how the IO-optimized plan can make pricing more predictable.


üôè Thank you to AWS for organizing!
