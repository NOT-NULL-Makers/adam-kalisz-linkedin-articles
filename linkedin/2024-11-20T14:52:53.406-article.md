⁉️** onsense or substance**?** uawei**,**  and ecurity**.


💡 In the west Huawei, ZTE and other prominent network equipment manufacturers are under great scrutiny and even prohibited for some use cases. Also some western companies are not allowed to deliver them components.

The basis seems to be** reports about backdoors **into the equipment that however are not accessible to the general public or are not very specific. Also, most backdoors could be genuine mistakes that occur in the western equipment as well.


👉 These bans were allegedly countered by warnings of economic nature by Chinese government officials. Based on the press coverage it seems these warnings were quite severe and were understood as threats.


👉 Surely there is politics involved and there might be some technical or security related basis for the bans.


**ut does it actually improve the security of networks meaningfully**❓


🤔 I don't think the western equipment has such a great security record either. Not a single month comes by without reading reports of mistakes I would call 

**gross negligence and systemic lack of sound engineering**.


👉 This will not be fixed with any high-level regulation such as #GDPR, #DORA, #NIS2, #DSA, #CRA or other in the EU. The problem is that systems became so complex hardly anybody understands all the interactions of the various components anymore in detail.


👉 We need a lot more transparency and documentation for the products we depend on. Customers should demand complete source code and technical drawings, including being able to verify the product corresponds to them. And we need to simplify on every level to make systems more understandable.
