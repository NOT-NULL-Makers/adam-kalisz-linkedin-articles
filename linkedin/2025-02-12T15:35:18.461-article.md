▦ EPC-QR-Code, GiroCode, QR-Rechnung, QR platba and various other options in Europe for simple wire transfers from the banking app are still hit or miss.


There are multiple standards, I know of at least 4:

🇪🇺 EPC-Code for Single Euro Payments Area (#SEPA) payments,

🇨🇭 QR-Rechnung for Switzerland,

🇨🇿 QR platba (SPAYD code) for Czechia,

🇵🇱 Płatności QR for Poland. 


👉 The codes are quite similar although they separate pieces of information e.g. by newlines, stars *, or vertical bars | and of course include mandatory or optional national specifics like the specific or constant symbol in Czechia.


🗝️ Also this is nothing new, since many of these approaches are more than 10 years old already. Supposedly it wasn't possible to think of a QR code that considers all of the approaches from the beginning and would be accepted by all countries at least in Europe whether they use the € or not.


🇩🇪 In Germany it seems to still be the case that most companies do not include a QR code for bank transfers because probably they want to be the “digitales Entwicklungsland” forever.


What do you think? Do you use QR codes for payment?
