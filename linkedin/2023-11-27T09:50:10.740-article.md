It seems in #Proxmox 8, you can end up with lacp_rate=slow when you use a vlan-aware bridge with too many VLANs above a 802.3ad bond.

The problem seems to be that the bridge-vlan-aware configuration probably offloads some of the work to the NIC, such as the Intel X710-DA4, which supports only ~100 active VLANs, not ~4000. So the bridge-vids 2-4094 is a bad idea and you should list the needed VLAN IDs explicitly.
Pushing too many VLANs into hardware can probably also trigger errors in the system log. At least I have seen some logs I haven't seen before.

If you have many guests that don't need to talk to each other over the same VLANs consider putting them on the bond directly without a bridge. Or don't use a vlan-aware bridge, which should keep the VLAN handling in software.

Yes, this is not a super systematic debugging or system analysis. But LACP works now with mode=802.3ad, miimon=100, and lacp_rate=1.
