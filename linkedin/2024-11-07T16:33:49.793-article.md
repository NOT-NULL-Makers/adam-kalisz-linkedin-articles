‚ùóIf you just like a programming language just admit it. You don't have to make up arguments for it or against other languages to make your case.


üîê You can write incorrect and insecure code in C++ and Python as well.


üò° You can write slow code in C++ and Python all the same. Yes, Python loops will be perhaps slower than a similar loop in low level C++ but for many things there will be a library.


ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You can write messy code in any language. Static type checking does not necessarily add any value to maintainability and you can do all kinds of type annotations and hints and enforce the checks in Python too if you really want to.


ü§î It just always strikes me how many people fall for this.
