🎄💃🕺** hristmas arties **with clients from the financial sector can get pretty wild –⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ an opportunity to build relationships, get some honest feedback and give a nudge to think more outside of the box.


🍲🍹 🍺** ood food**,** drinks **and a relaxed atmosphere with the cover of loud music and darker corners of the venue can help to put aside the daily stress to work with “chips on the table” and focus on longer term issues for a brief moment.


🤝 And it is possible to** network **as well. Our flyers with concrete showcases, strategically placed rollups and the ability to join conversations allowed us to meet potential customers or partners. Especially the energy market has a big potential.


What is your experience? Do you think such parties are a waste of time and money or do you see them as important ice breakers?
